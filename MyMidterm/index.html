        <div id="subtitle">DVRPC Regional Circuit Trails</div>
        <p id="main">
          In Great Philadelphia Region, there are a variety of opportunities to create a connected network of
          multi-use trails. Some of them are long-existing railway and some are parts of grennway corridors
          alongside the region's creek buffering and park systems. A number of significant trail segments already
          exist or under construction, but there are still gaps between segments.<br><br>
          In May 2012, efforts in the Philadelphia Mayor Office were made to fill the gaps and connected the network
          of these multi-use trails called The Circuits, working with foundations, governments, non-profit organizations,
          economic development professionals and many other groups. These efforts are valuable in improving the accessibility
          and promoting multi-use transportation systems on the regional level of the Great Philadelphia.

        <div id="subtitle">Bicycle Counts</div>
        <p id="main">
          Each circle reflects the counts of the bicycles on that location, and there are 2258 locations on the map collected
          by DVRPC. As shown on the map, most of the data are clustered in Philadelphia center city, and locations on the Circuits
          do have larger number of bicycle counts than locations outside the trails. Some trails extending from Philadelphia center
          city to the outside regions have higher bicycle counts than other trails, and there are some locations with high bicycle
          counts do not have good access to the Circuit.<br><br>
          This map is useful as a reference showing areas and paths with higher biking demands, and potential locations where more
          bike lanes and biking facilities can be built.

      <div id="page3">
        <div id="subtitle">Pedestrian Counts</div>
        <p id="main">
          DVRPC also has the pedestrian counts. Compared to the bicycle counts map which is more randomly scattered, the pedestrian map
          is more concentrated on the central Philadelphia, and there is a clear path on the map running from the northwest of the region
          to the central Philadelphia that has higher pedestrian counts than other areas. I don't know the reason why there is an distinctive
          path on the map, but this is an interesting finding.

      <div id="page4">
        <div id="subtitle">Bicycle and Pedestrian Pattern</div>
        <p id="main">
          By overlaying the bicycle and pedestrian counts map, I am trying to find if there is any relationship between the bicycle and pedestrian
          patterns. I do find that the path with high pedestrian counts has high bicycle counts as well. Although I am not sure where this path leads
          to, but the data tells me that this path may have great multi-uses (especially the non-motorized) transit demands.<br><br>
          However, since most of the locations are clustered in Philadelphia center city, it is hard to see the data on this map. Click the "Next"
          button below to zoom into central city.

      <div id="page5">
        <div id="subtitle">Bicycle and Pedestrian Counts in Philadelphia Center City</div>
        <p id="main">
          When zomming in, we can see a more clear pattern. Notably, the northeast area in the center city - the area between Market and Spring Garden Streets,
          and between the 2nd and 5th Streets, has higher bicycle counts than other areas. The South Broad Street extending from center city to the south,
          and the Chestnut Street extending to University City, also have high bicycle counts.<br><br>
          I expect the pedestrian counts in center city to be higher, but the data is not as high as I expected. There are a few locations with high pedestrian
          counts though, and most of them are near the waterfront, which indicates that the environment of the waterfront areas are good, and people like to
          go there.
